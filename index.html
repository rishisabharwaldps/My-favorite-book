    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>Books are manâ€™s best friends. Books are portable and so they are easy to carry around. And so books can be read at any time night or day, while travelling on a bus or train or flight, and at meal time too. Books are published in many languages and in varied genres. There are books in fiction and non-fiction categories. Each of these categories has many different sections and genres, and there are many thousands of titles in each type. Every book title has an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) that is unique to it, and helps in identifying it. Today books are available as web versions too so that they can be read on the internet. They may be read on the modern kindle or on the computer. And books are available in audio versions too so that you can hear an entire book being read out aloud.</p>
